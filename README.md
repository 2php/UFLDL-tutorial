These are solutions to the exercises up at the [Stanford OpenClassroom Deep Learning class](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=DeepLearning) and [Andrew Ng's UFLDL Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial). I looked around for copies of the solutions so I could compare notes, but almost everything I found was incomplete or wrong. I don't promise that these aren't wrong, but they at least give outputs within the range of the expected outputs for the assignments.

Apologies for the mess. I'll clean this up when I have some spare time. Pull requests welcome, of course.
